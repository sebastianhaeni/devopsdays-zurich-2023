# Day 2

Summarizes day 2 of the DevOpsDays Zurich 2023.


## Keynote-Speaker

__Topic__: Developer Productivity Engineering â€“ The Next Big Thing in Software Development

__Takeaways__:

- [Coding War Games](https://fs.blog/increasing-the-productivity-of-computer-programmers-and-engineers). Goal: Figure out good traits of efficient developers
  - Non-Factors: Programming Language, Years of Experience, Defects, Salary
  - Factors:
    - Paired programmers from the same org performed at roughly the same level
    - Average difference was only 21% between paired programmers
    - They didn't work together on the task.
    - Difference between developers of different organizations was 1:10
  - Conclusion: 
    - Some companies are doing a lot worse than others.
    - It comes down to developer experience at a company.
    - 10x engineering is manufactured, not born.
- DPE - Developer Productivity Engineering - should be a core discipline at every company
- Predictive Test Selection - Use ML to select which tests to run. Only use pre-merge!
  - [White Paper](https://research.facebook.com/publications/predictive-test-selection/)
- Correct question to ask: Is the (feedback) cycle as fast as it can possibly be?
- Idea: Measure local build time and failure rates across organization.

> It is staggering with how much toil, friction and frustrations engineers are willing to put up with.

> The world should foster developer joy.
