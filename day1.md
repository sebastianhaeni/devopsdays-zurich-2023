## Talk 1

__Topic__: Reporting on Reliability - Improving stakeholder conversations

__Takeaways__:

- The goal is not 100% uptime.
- Incident steps
  - What the heck?! => Incident status
  - What was that? => Postmortem
  - How's it going? => Periodic reviews

__Real-time incident managemenet__:

- Use chat
- Use live document (i.e. Google Docs)
- External people read the chat & doc, they don't ask questions
- People can offer help, but the response team first has to ack' for them to start helping

__Periodic Reviews__:

- Don't focus on incident counts. Each incident is unique
- Do focus on aggregated impact of incidents
  - Revenue lost
  - Error budget burned
  - Blast radius
  - Teams/Services affected
  - Look for patterns
- Look back: Team health
  - People: Does the team have the right mix of skills? What training can we offer?
  - Cognitive load: Is the team at capacity, or can they onboard additional services?
  - Toil: Are we doing the right amount? Are we learning from it?
  - Interrupts: Consder a paging "budget", (e.g. max 2 per on-call shift)
  - Morale: A happy team is a reliable team

__Look ahead__:

- Forecast demand
  - What capacity will be needed?
  - What other factors will become relevant?
- Forecast: work to be done
  - What's in the reliability backlog? What might prevent it from getting prioritized?
- Plans
  - Are stakeholders expecting improved reliability? Can we achieve it?
  - What launches are coming, for this team or related teams?
  - What known future bottlenecks/deprecations/etc can we prepare for?
